# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created to document and explore the concept of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of **gathering, understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations** of stakeholders for a software system.  
It is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for designing, developing, and testing the system. Without well-defined requirements, software projects risk failure, scope creep, or delivering a product that does not meet user expectations.
###  Importance of Requirement Analysis:
1. **Clarity and Understanding**: Ensures developers, testers, and stakeholders have a common understanding.  
2. **Minimizes Risks**: Reduces chances of project failure by identifying constraints early.  
3. **Improves Quality**: Helps deliver a system that meets actual user needs.  
4. **Saves Time and Cost**: Prevents rework and costly fixes later in the development cycle.
